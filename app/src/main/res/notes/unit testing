what is unit testing.

We can test small peice of code in isolation
Motive is to identify bugs
And we have to write modular code for seperation of concerns
So we have modular and extensible code

Why we write test case in isolation because our test case shouldnt fail due to external reasons

-----------------------------------------------------
Junit - logic can be test with JVM and no need to device called unit testing
Instrumentation test - we need device to test test case called instrumentation testing
Espresso - Its UI test

Unit test cases faster than Instrumentation test

Instrumentation test case written on androidTest
JVM test case written on test



Notes :

we should use same package structure to write unit test case, so that no visibility issues come
